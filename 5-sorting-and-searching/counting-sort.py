"""
Counting sort is stable sort which takes Î˜(k+n)
Step 1: create an empty array b with length a, b is responsible to store the sorted array
Step 2: create an empty array c with length c, c is responsible for counting the number of value in a
    ex: a has 2 value 6 and 1 value 0 then c = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
Step 3: counting the number of value in a
Step 4: accumulated the counting value in c to signal that at value i we have how many values equal and
    smaller to, ex: a has 2 value 0, 2 value 1, 1 value 2, so at position 2, 
        it will have 5 elements equal or smaller than it, c = [2, 4, 5]
Step 5: based on what we counting, arrange the right position to array b and return it
