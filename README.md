My coding exercise when studying algorithms, data structures, and solving other things

### **Sorting**

- [x] Bubble sort
- [x] Selection sort
- [x] Insertion sort
- [x] Merge sort
- [x] Quick sort
- [x] Heap sort
- [x] Counting sort
- [x] Radix sort
- [x] Bucket sort

### **Divdide and Conquer**

- [x] An algorithm which is faster than the quadratic "grade school" by turning original problem into smaller problems (karatsuba-multiplication)
- [x] Find the maximum profit of 1 time buying and selling stock, given the stock price (maximum-subarray)
- [x] Find a lowest altitude that a ball can roll into compared to its neighbors(local-minimum)
- [x] Measure the similarity between users about ranking favorite movies - collaborative filtering technique (counting-inversions)
- [ ] (closest-pair)
- [x] An algorithm with faster running time comparing to normal matrix multiplication we take from linear algebra course (strassen-matrix-multiplication)

### **Data Structures**

- [ ] Heap
- [ ] Hash tables
- [ ] Binary search trees
- [ ] Red-black trees
- [ ] B-tree
- [ ] Linked lists
- [ ] Stacks and queues
