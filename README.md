My coding exercise when studying algorithms, data structures, solving games and puzzles.

## **Algorithms**

### **Sorting**

Comparison-based sorting: these models must take at least Î©(nlogn) steps

- [x] Bubble sort
- [x] Selection sort
- [x] Insertion sort
- [x] Merge sort
- [x] Quick sort
- [x] Heap sort

Linear-time sorting:

- [x] Counting sort
- [x] Radix sort
- [x] Bucket sort
- [x] Linear select

### **Divdide and Conquer**

- [x] An algorithm which is faster than the quadratic "grade school" by turning original problem into smaller problems (karatsuba-multiplication)
- [x] Find the maximum profit of 1 time buying and selling stock, given the stock price (maximum-subarray)
- [x] Find a lowest altitude that a ball can roll into compared to its neighbors(local-minimum)
- [x] Measure the similarity between users about ranking favorite movies - collaborative filtering technique (counting-inversions)
- [ ] (closest-pair)
- [x] An algorithm with faster running time comparing to normal matrix multiplication we take from linear algebra course (strassen-matrix-multiplication)

### **Backtracking**

- [ ] N-Queens
- [ ] Knapsack
- [ ] Maze
- [ ] Color graph

### **Dynamic Programming**

- [ ] Cut Rod
- [ ] Fibonacci
- [ ] Knapsack
- [ ] Longest common sequence

## **Data Structures**

### **Trees**

- [x] Binary search trees
- [x] Red-black trees
- [ ] B-tree
- [x] Heap
- [x] Hash tables

### **Graphs**

- [x] Undirected and directed graph class (graph_hash.py vs graph_linked_list.py)
- [x] DFS and typological sorting - Sort clothing when getting dressed or scheduling classes' order based on its prequeresite (graph_hash.py vs graph_linked_list.py)
- [x] DFS and simple path - How many ways get to B from A? (graph_hash.py vs graph_linked_list.py)
- [x] DFS and strongly connected components - Used in detecting network failure, data visualization and clustering (graph_hash.py vs graph_linked_list.py)
- [x] BFS and shortest path - Find a Bacon number, which is the number of degrees of separation from an actor to Kevin Bacon (graph_hash.py vs graph_linked_list.py)
- [x] BFS and bipartiteness testing - Seperate objects into two so that it will not conflict with the other (graph_hash.py vs graph_linked_list.py)
- [x] Dijkstra's - Find the shortest path in non-negative weighted graph (graph_weight.py)
- [x] Bellman Ford - Find the shortest path in graph which has negative weights (graph_weight.py)
- [x] DAG shortest paths - An algorithm of PERT application, which helps arrange and performs tasks more efficiently (graph_weighted.py)
- [x] Floyd Warshall - Find all pairs shortest path (graph_weighted.py)
- [x] Johnson - Find all pairs shortest path (graph_weighted.py)
- [x] Transitive Closure - Check if there is a path from one destination to another detination (graph_weighted.py)
