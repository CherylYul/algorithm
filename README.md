### **Divdide and Conquer**

- [ ] (karatsuba-multiplication)
- [x] Find the maximum profit of 1 time buying and selling stock, given the stock price (maximum-subarray)
- [x] Find a lowest altitude that a ball can roll into compared to its neighbors(local-minimum)
- [x] Measure the similarity between users about ranking favorite movies - collaborative filtering technique (counting-inversions)
- [ ] (closest-pair)
- [x] An algorithm with faster running time comparing to normal matrix multiplication we take from linear algebra course (strassen-matrix-multiplication)
