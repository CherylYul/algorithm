My coding exercise when studying algorithms, data structures, and solving other things

### **Sorting**

- [x] Bubble sort
- [x] Insertion sort
- [x] Selection sort
- [x] Merge sort
- [ ] Quick sort

### **Divdide and Conquer**

- [x] Find the maximum profit of 1 time buying and selling stock, given the stock price (maximum-subarray)
- [x] Find a lowest altitude that a ball can roll into compared to its neighbors(local-minimum)
- [ ] (counting-inversions)
- [ ] (closest-pair)
- [x] A faster running time of algorithm than normal matrix multiplication we take from linear algebra course (strassen-matrix-multiplication)
